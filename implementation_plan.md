# Refinement: advanced Intelligence & Integrity

## 🛡️ Zero Hallucination & Confidence Score

The framework now includes a mandatory **Validation Layer**:

- **Confidence Score:** An honest % reflecting the match.
- **Gap Analysis:** A "No Bullshit" section where the AI tells the user exactly what's missing, helping them prepare for hard technical questions.

## 🌐 Culture Radar (Web-Enhanced)

The AI is now instructed to use its web browsing capabilities (when available) to:

- Investigate company values and mission.
- Read technical blogs to understand the engineering culture.
- Adapt the CV's tone to resonate with the specific company "Vibe".

## 🤝 The Human Factor (Ethos)

Soft skills are no longer a separate list but are woven into the technical narrative, emphasizing:

- **Integrity:** Honest representation of skills.
- **Proactivity:** Demonstrating ownership of the Marketplace and other projects.
- **Alignment:** How the user's personal motivation matches the company's goals.
